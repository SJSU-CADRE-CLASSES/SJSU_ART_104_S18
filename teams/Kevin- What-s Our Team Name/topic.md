Drones: A fictional look at the realities of UAVs mjhf


Abstract 1: Cetacean Rehabilitation

While the concept of drones may seem newfangled to Americans, their uses have become more realized in recent years. From package deliveries to news traffic coverage, remotely controlled drones are allowing us to vicariously traverse the skies— and the seas. Skip, a humpback whale extending 44 feet living only miles off the shores of Martha’s Vineyard, was inspected and led to safety by a series of six-propeller hexacopters collecting data over the Atlantic. Cetacean rehabilitation is being aided by artificial intelligence algorithms poetically and proactively absolving the seas of marine terrorism— of invasive toxins massacring our world's most complex ecosystem. Our new reality—a world wherein we will soon gaze up to the heavens and see a structure of drones bustling about—will ameliorate the way we do commerce, abolish poverty, and advance our society into a globally aware future. 


Abstract 2: Nation Annihilation

The Purpose of this paper is to narrow down the many uses of operating, owning, and using drones. As technology advances, new and innovative ways begin to surface. Drones have been on the rise for years now making their way from the private sectors to being commercially available to the public.  We will look at three aspects of the usage of drones in our society. First, from the controller’s perspective the once operating the drones; second from the small business sectors, agriculture and marine. And third, the dangers when technology is used for warfare. By looking further into these three aspects we expect to widen our understanding on the inner positive and negative workings of everyday use of drones in our society. New innovative technology such as drones are made because there is a need for them and with that need comes job creations, the operator; easier ways to accomplish certain tasks such as fertilizing of fields and testing of wild life; and the negative implications it can cause
